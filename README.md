# VisionProject2

This project has everything you need to run the Game Engine for the Vision Project in Object Oriented Design

Note: The project https://github.com/mlepinski/VisionProject has only the files related to the PlayerTeam interface 
(which is what you are implementing for this project)
This project additionally has the backend code for actually running a game

To run a game, compile all of the java files in LepinskiEngine (you will need JavaFX)
Then run: java LepinskiEngine.GameEngine

Note: This code assumes that your active (current) directory contains the example1.maze

This project includes a TestTeam as an example (that team is bad and will not pick up any coins)
If you want to run the GameEngine with a different type of PlayerTeam, 
... You can change the line in the Constructor of GameEngine which creates a new TestTeam()

Don't hesitate to email me if you have any questions!
